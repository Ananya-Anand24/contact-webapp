## Deploying to Production

To deploy the application to a production environment, you can use any cloud platform. Below are high-level steps for deploying to [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/), and [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/).

### Recommended Cloud Platform: AWS (Amazon Web Services)

Here’s a brief overview of deploying the app on AWS from **both Windows** and **Mac** environments:

1. **Set up an EC2 instance**:
   - Log into your [AWS account](https://aws.amazon.com/).
   - Launch a new EC2 instance with your preferred OS (e.g., Amazon Linux or Ubuntu).
   - Connect to the EC2 instance via SSH (you can use **PuTTY** on Windows or **Terminal** on Mac for SSH).

2. **Install Node.js on EC2**:
   - SSH into your EC2 instance.
   - Install Node.js and npm:

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install nodejs npm
   ```

3. **Clone the repository**:
   - Run the following commands on your EC2 instance:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ananya-Anand24/contact-webapp.git
   cd contact-webapp
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

5. **Start the application**:

```bash
npm start
```

6. **Access the application**:
   - Ensure the EC2 instance’s security group allows inbound traffic on port 3000.
   - Open a web browser and go to `http://<EC2_PUBLIC_IP>:3000`.

You may also use services like [Elastic Beanstalk](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticbeanstalk/) for easier deployment management.

### Alternative Cloud Platforms

You can also deploy to other platforms like GCP or Azure, following these general steps:

- **For GCP**: You can use [Google Cloud App Engine](https://cloud.google.com/appengine) or a Compute Engine instance.
- **For Azure**: You can deploy using [Azure App Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/app-service/).

For more information on deploying to these platforms, consult their respective documentation:

- [GCP Deployment Guide](https://cloud.google.com/docs)
- [Azure Deployment Guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/app-service/)
